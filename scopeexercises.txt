1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
	x = 1;
	var a = 5;
	var b = 10;
	var c = function(a, b, c) {
		var x = 10;
		document.write(x);
		document.write(a);
		var f = function(a, b, c) {
			b = a;
			document.write(b);
			b = c;
			var x = 5;
		}
		f(a,b,c);
		document.write(b);
 	}
	c(8,9,10);
	document.write(b);
	document.write(x);
}
The outputs are: 10  undefined  undefined  undefined

2. What is the difference between a method and function?
A function is a block of code written to perform some specific set of tasks.
A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
The this keyword in Java method refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
The 'this' keyword in a Javascript method refers to the enclosing object where the method is defined.

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
The 'this' keyword in a constructor function does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object.

6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
In this case 'this' keyword refers to object x.

7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?
Free variable is a variable defined outside of the current function, that means it is not a not a parameter or defined locally in the current function.

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
var myObj = {
	name: "fred",
	major: "music",
	myFunc: function(a, b){
		return a < b? a : b;
	}
}
9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
function Employee(name, salary, position) {
  this.name = name;
  this.salary = salary;
  this.position = position;
  
}
var emp1 = new Employee("Max", 8500, "Software developer");
var emp2 = new Employee("Elon", 25000, "Manager");
var emp3 = new Employee("John", 10000, "Project manager");

10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.
function anyNumberOfArguments(){
	var product = 0;
	for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
		product *= arguments[i];
	}
	return product;
}

11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments
var func = (a, b, c) => Math.max(Math.max(a, b), c);
